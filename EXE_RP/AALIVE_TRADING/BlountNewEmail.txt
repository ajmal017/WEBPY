*Thank you William! *

This was Friday's S2L  and the accompanying SPOTS CHART..It is being sent
to show how thew JUMP BALL CLOSE from Thursday that did not CONVERT 2103.5
SPOT to support was IMPACTED by a KNOWN CATALYST, the NFP. Then it
highlights the following :

1. THE POST NEWS reaction GLOMS TO THE NUMBAHS/SPOTS and bounces off both
2091.5 and 2095.5 ..Long term readers are familiar with the PRICE GLOMS TO
NUMBHAS on NEWS REACTIONS.. This does NOT mean the SPILL UP does not happen
, IT DOES but it is highly probable that the SPILL WILL BE RESIDUAL, i.e.
it will not trade back to the PRIOR CLOSE where it would be 'real',,,,


2. The Back through of 2095.5 'seals the spill' at 2098 (future possible
price information for aberrant outcomes as the NORMAL S2L is a.m. low to
last hour HOD).

3. A warning has been issued that LONGS are bounce ONLY trades because the
SPILL is SEALED unless price can go back through 2095.5 SPOT UP and that
warning is in effect until the A.M. LOW is ID'D.

4. Before the OPEN RTH, it has already been determined that the 2095.5 SPOT
would be the OVER UNDER SPOT AND  PRICE OF THE DAY(POD)...9:24

5. The .A.M. LOW was identified 44 seconds after exact occurrence and  2083
SPOT used ALL WEEK was the initial risk marker for longs...

6. for tracking LONGS 2091.5 was given as first need with a emphasis on the
2095.5 FOR LUNCH high NEED accompanying upon A.M. LOW ID AT 10:21 BAR

6b. The  2091.5  SPOT was identified  as the need to hold  with NO MORE
THAN A STOP RUN REVERSAL ( -.25 to -.75 ) for leeway...

7. The TOO early was a response to DBOY , Danny RILEY when he inquired if
the afternoon low was in place...

8. A 2091.5 SPOT double bottom without violating the STOP RUN REVERSAL
PARAMETER produced the 'acceptable but early' as opposed to TOO EARLY was
issued.

9. DURING the assault on 2095.5 from to the 2:30 bar it was reiterated
multiple times that the BULLS were not out of the woods and SEVERAL
reiterations that a touch of 2096.75 was NEEDED to confirm the move to the
LAST HOUR HIGH with nothing left to BEARS ..

10.Shortly after the touch of   2096.75 as we were approaching the SPILL
HIGH 2098, a reminder of the NORMAL IS A LAST HOUR HOD (high of day) and
the earliest IN MEMORY for  WEAK LAST HOUR HIGH was 2:56 p.m.  on S2L  was
posted.

11: the weak close and bucking the odds of FRIDAY NORMALLY SKEWS UP ON THE
BOOK SQUARING (sweet spot for time origin of book square is 3:37-3:43) will
be part of the regular commentary HONING SECTION...

SUMMARY ==NEWS IMPACTED SPILL ...NORMAL S2L  day albeit with a WEAK LAST
HOUR HIGH. The book square is NOT part of the 4 day calendar cycle it is an
observation that has been emphasized by Art Cashin for years and I concur.
This does however provide us with 2 weak tells at day end: weak last hour
 hod TIME  WISE  and no book square up...
