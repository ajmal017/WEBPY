bla std sig from file
Anyways, I use this ip string particularly in a script I used to email myself the ip of a host

Basically, all you have to do is host a php page containing only the following:

<?php 
 //Gets the IP address
 $ip = getenv("REMOTE_ADDR") ; 
 Echo $ip;
 ?>
name is something like myip.php and place it in your root web page folder so to access your ip, you can visit it through a URL like this:

www.myhost.com/myip.php
